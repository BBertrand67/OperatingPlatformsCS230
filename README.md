#This section of the readme covers Operating Platforms Project 3 Software Design Document for The Gaming Room's game "Draw It or Lose It."

#Q: Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
#A: The Gaming Room requested that we help them develop their existing game "Draw It or Lose It" for use on Mac, Linux, Windows, and iOS platforms. Initially the game was only available on the Android platform. On the server side of this game the customer asked that we create a web-based application. This server configuration would allow them to host for thousands of players. On the client side of the game they required that the game operate in a modern, responsive HTML interface running inside the web browser for desktop clients as well as mobile platforms. 

#Q: What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
#A: Using the experience I have gained over many years in different technology fields and through education, I was able to apply this to the different variations of platforms and outline the details that would provide the greatest benefits to the customers platform.

#Q: What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
#A: The design document was very helpful in keeping all of the information and the design structure of the code organized. This made the entire process less stressful when trying to maintain the order of operations that needed to be completed. With the UML diagram this provides a great visual aid of the software structure and design.

#Q: If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
#A: There are parts of the document I could condense more to reduce the number of words and provide the technical information for the customer.

#Q: How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
#A: Many of these details were provided by the customer. Some of this information is dependent on the devices owned by the users to play the game. Also different platforms were evailated to determine the best archetecture to maintain the operating interface between the client and server systems. In this case the REST API was the most advantageous for this platform to run on and host for a variety of devices.

#Q: How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
#A: This software design template was a very valuable tool and lesson for future projects. I would highly recommend using this for other projects as well due to the many advantages of its organized structure and how it covers the many areas of software development. Before learning this my methods were not as organized and there were issues due to that.
